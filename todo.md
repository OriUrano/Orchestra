### Security Vulnerabilities
- [ ] **Add input sanitization for GitHub data**
  - GitHub responses passed directly to Claude Code without validation
  - Potential for injection attacks or data corruption

- [ ] **Implement secure subprocess handling**
  - `subprocess.run` calls could be vulnerable to command injection
  - Add proper argument validation and sanitization

- [ ] **Add secrets management**
  - Prevent API tokens or sensitive data from appearing in logs
  - Implement proper credential handling and rotation

- [ ] **Add configuration access controls**
  - Anyone with file system access can modify configs
  - Need validation and access restrictions

### Critical System Reliability
- [ ] **Add comprehensive error handling with retry logic**
  - GitHub API calls and Claude Code requests have no retry mechanisms
  - System fails completely on temporary network issues

- [ ] **Implement circuit breaker pattern**
  - Continuous failures could exhaust API limits
  - Need protection against cascading failures

- [ ] **Add configuration validation**
  - YAML files can contain invalid data without detection
  - Add schema validation with clear error messages

- [ ] **Complete task scheduler integration**
  - Task persistence exists but doesn't integrate with main execution loop
  - Tasks are created but never properly completed or tracked

## üöÄ HIGH PRIORITY (Next Sprint)

### Monitoring & Observability
- [ ] **Implement comprehensive logging throughout system**
  - `logging_utils.py` exists but not integrated everywhere
  - Add structured logging with proper levels

- [ ] **Add health checks and system monitoring**
  - No way to verify system is operating correctly
  - Implement status endpoints and health indicators

- [ ] **Add metrics collection**
  - No tracking of system performance or usage patterns
  - Implement key performance indicators

### Testing Gaps
- [ ] **Add integration tests**
  - Current tests mock everything but don't test real integrations
  - Need tests that verify actual GitHub and Claude Code interactions

- [ ] **Add end-to-end workflow tests**
  - No tests that verify complete workday/worknight/weekend cycles
  - Critical for ensuring system works as intended

- [ ] **Add error scenario testing**
  - Edge cases and failure modes aren't well tested
  - Need comprehensive failure testing

### Performance & Resource Management
- [ ] **Add connection pooling for GitHub API**
  - Each API call creates new connections
  - Implement efficient connection reuse

- [ ] **Implement caching mechanism**
  - Repeated GitHub API calls for same data waste resources
  - Add intelligent caching with proper invalidation

- [ ] **Fix memory management**
  - Large GitHub responses aren't properly cleaned up
  - Implement proper resource cleanup

### Deployment & Operations
- [ ] **Create systemd service deployment**
  - Currently only supports cron-based scheduling
  - Add more robust service management

- [ ] **Add backup/restore functionality**
  - No way to backup or restore system state
  - Critical for operational reliability

- [ ] **Implement configuration management**
  - No way to manage configs across environments
  - Add environment-specific configuration support

### Medium Priority
- [ ] **Enhanced configuration validation**
  - YAML schema validation
  - Better error messages for config issues
  - Configuration file templates

- [ ] **Improve usage limit detection**
  - More accurate token counting
  - Real-time usage monitoring
  - Predictive limit warnings

- [ ] **Add notification system**
  - Slack/Discord integration for status updates
  - Email alerts for critical issues
  - Summary reports for completed work
